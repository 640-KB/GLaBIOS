### You spoke, we listened!

The results of the poll for [tagline for the next major version](https://github.com/640-KB/GLaBIOS/discussions/14) are in, and the winner is... everybody!  GLaBIOS will now choose a different tagline on every reboot, based on mood.

## Features

- A complete [100% PC Compatible](#compatibility) BIOS for retro/vintage PC, XT, 8088 Clone, Turbo and Homebrew PCs.
- FAST! [Performance-optmized](doc/about/perf.md) CGA/MDA text and graphics routines.
- 5150 Cassette tape support.
- NEC V20 enhanced instruction set support.
- Multiple levels of "[CGA snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Limitations,_bugs_and_errata)" removal (configurable at build-time).
- Accurate PIT-based I/O timing for floppy disk, 10-15% faster seek and read times.
- Customizable POST test screen colors themes.
- Fits in an 8K ROM to drop in to any original PC or clone.

### Platforms Supported

- PC/XT 5160 and clones
- PC 5150 with cassette
- Turbo XTs (DTK, most clones)
- [Faraday FE2010A](https://github.com/skiselev/micro_8088/blob/master/Documentation/Faraday-XT_Controller-FE2010A.md)-based PCs ([Headstart Plus](http://oldcomputer.info/pc/hs_plus/index.htm)/VTI Vendex 33-XT/PC-10 and others)
- TD3900A-based PCs (Juko ST-12, UNIQUE, Auva, etc)
- Support for [EMM Homebrew 8088](https://www.homebrew8088.com/) with 8088, V20 or V40
- Emulator-optmized ([86Box](https://86box.net/) and others) for improved performance and stability
- Experimental support for [micro_8088](https://github.com/skiselev/micro_8088) / [NuXT](https://monotech.fwscart.com/) (looking for testers!)

## FAQ

### Why another 8088 PC BIOS in 2022?

There are other excellent BIOS projects out there each with it's own design goals and use cases. The goals for GLaBIOS are:

1. A collborative learning effort among the Retro Community
2. A fully open-source PC BIOS, built and improved by the community, free of outside proprietary or copyrighted code
3. Feature-complete with full support for original vintage hardware as well as new projects

### Where did the name originate?

## BUILD NOTES:

### Assembler Version

Build using MASM 5 or later.

### Build Process:

1. `MASM GLABIOS;`
2. `LINK GLABIOS;`  Will create GLABIOS.EXE.
3. Run `GLA2ROM GLABIOS` to convert to an 8 KiB ROM file.

OR

1. Convert EXE manually by removing the EXE header (the first 512 bytes of the EXE file) and extracting the last 8 KiB
2. Calculate 8-bit checksum byte and insert into relative file offset `1FFF` in GLABIOS.ROM.

### Testing

Hampa Hug's excellent [PCE/ibmpc emulator](http://hampa.ch/pce/pce-ibmpc.html) works very well for build testing and debugging.  This provides a near-perfect hardware-accurate emulation of a PC with inspection of ICs, memory and code stepping.  [86Box](http://86box.net/) and [PCem](http://pcem-emulator.co.uk/index.html) also work very well.

### Real Hardware Deployment

[Minuszerodegrees (-0Â°)](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/) has a lot of information about [original ROM types](http://minuszerodegrees.net/rom/rom.htm) and "modern" equivalents. I found using [Winbond W27E257](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/rom/misc/Winbond%20W27E257%20as%2027C256%20replacement.htm) EEPROMs worked very well since it could be electrically erased and re-written quickly.  Since these are 32K EEPROMS, the image will need to be written 4 times sequentially.  I use a TL866 II Plus to write the EEPROMs.
