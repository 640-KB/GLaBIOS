## Features

- A complete [100% PC Compatible](#compatibility) BIOS for retro/vintage PC, XT, 8088 Clone or Turbo PCs.
- Support for 5150, 5160, Turbo and compatible clone hardware.
- FAST! [Performance-optmized](doc/about/perf.md) CGA/MDA text and graphics routines.
- Multiple levels of "[CGA snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Limitations,_bugs_and_errata)" removal (configurable at build-time).
- Accurate PIT-based I/O timing. Better stability at faster clock speeds and increased speed on slower PCs.
- NEC V20 enhanced instruction set support (enabled at build-time).
- POST test screen colors support easily customized themes (build-time).
- **Coming Soon:** 5150 Cassette tape support.

## FAQ

### Why another 8088 PC BIOS in 2022?

Because learning.  I've always wanted to know what actually happens inside the big gray box
and how everything actually works on a PC. Like an old car, radio or TV it's actually possible
for a hobbyist to learn all of the inner workings and be able to repair or build.

### Where did the name originate?

If you aren't familiar with the reference, ask a gamer.

### Project Goals

There are several other excellent BIOS projects out there each with it's own design goals and use cases. These are the goals for this one:

1. Learning
2. A fully open-source PC BIOS, built and improved by the community, free of outside proprietary or copyrighted code
3. Feature-complete with full support for original vintage hardware
4. Fit in an 8K ROM to drop in to any original PC or clone

## BUILD NOTES:

### Assembler Version

Built using MASM 5.0. MASM and it's syntax has been what I have used and most familiar with in assembly programming. It also provides some sense of historical authenticity _[citation needed]_.

### Code Formatting
- Tab Size: 6 spaces. Indented with TAB characters.

### Code style:
GLaBIOS uses all UPPERCASE mnemonics because 1) it was the way I originally
learned assembly language 2) it's what's used in MASM 5 documentation
and manuals 3) it would have been an accepted practice in the era in when 
PC BIOS clones were written.

### Build Process:

1. `MASM GLABIOS;`
2. `LINK GLABIOS;`  Will create GLABIOS.EXE.
3. Run `GLA2ROM GLABIOS` to convert to an 8 KiB ROM file.

OR

3. Convert EXE manually by removing the EXE header (the first 512 bytes of the EXE file) and extracting the last 8 KiB
4. Calculate 8-bit checksum byte and insert into relative file offset `1FFF` in GLABIOS.ROM.

### Testing

Hampa Hug's excellent [PCE/ibmpc emulator](http://hampa.ch/pce/pce-ibmpc.html) works very well for build testing and debugging.  This provides a near-perfect hardware-accurate emulation of a PC with inspection of ICs, memory and code stepping.  [86Box](http://86box.net/) and [PCem](http://pcem-emulator.co.uk/index.html) also work very well.

### Real Hardware Deployment

[Minuszerodegrees (-0Â°)](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/) has a lot of information about [original ROM types](http://minuszerodegrees.net/rom/rom.htm) and "modern" equivalents. I found using [Winbond W27E257](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/rom/misc/Winbond%20W27E257%20as%2027C256%20replacement.htm) EEPROMs worked very well since it could be electrically erased and re-written quickly.  Since these are 32K EEPROMS, the image will need to be written 4 times sequentially.  I use a TL866 II Plus to write the EEPROMs.
